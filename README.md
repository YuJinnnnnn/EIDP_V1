# Shooting Stars in Processing

This project creates a dynamic "shooting star" visual effect using Processing. Each "star" is represented by a small, colored circle with a trailing effect in muted Morandi colors.

## Features

- **Shooting Star Effect**: Stars cascade with trailing tails, simulating a shooting effect.
- **Morandi Color Palette**: Uses soft, desaturated colors for an aesthetic look.
- **Dynamic Density**: Higher star density with small spacing.
- **Recording**: Press `R` to start/stop recording frames as PNGs.

## Installation

1. Download and install [Processing](https://processing.org/).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open `ShootingStars.pde` in Processing and run the sketch.

## Files

- **ShootingStars.pde**: Main sketch file.
- **Char.pde**: Defines the individual "star" behavior.
- **Stream.pde**: Manages star trails and movement.

## Usage

- **Toggle Recording**: Press `R` to save frames to the `video` folder.
