# Shooting Stars in Processing

This project creates a dynamic "shooting star" visual effect using Processing. Each "star" is represented by a small, colored circle with a trailing effect in muted Morandi colors.

- **Morandi Color Palette**: Uses soft, desaturated colors for an aesthetic look.

- **Recording**: Press `R` to start/stop recording frames as PNGs.

## Installation

1. Download and install [Processing](https://processing.org/).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open `Emotion_Tree_Main.pde` in Processing and run the sketch.

## Files

- **Emotion_Tree_Main.pde**: Main sketch file.
- **Emotion_Tree_Char.pde**: Defines the individual "star" behavior.
- **Emotion_Tree_Stream.pde**: Manages star trails and movement.

## Usage
